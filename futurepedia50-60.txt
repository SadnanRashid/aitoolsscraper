It recognizes the completion of its response when the input prompt ends with the token \"### Response:\\n\". The model is trained specifically for English conversations.\n\nDeployment and Example Code: The deployment of the LightGPT-instruct-6B model to Amazon SageMaker is supported, and the documentation provides example code to illustrate the process.\n\nEvaluation Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including LAMBADA PPL (perplexity), LAMBADA ACC (accuracy), WINOGRANDE, HELLASWAG, PIQA, and GPT-J.\n\nLimitations: The documentation highlights certain limitations of the model. These include its potential to struggle with accurately following long instructions, providing incorrect answers to math and reasoning questions, and occasionally generating false or misleading responses. The model also lacks contextual understanding and generates responses solely based on the given prompt.\n\nUse Case: The LightGPT-instruct-6B model is a natural language generation tool suitable for generating responses to a wide range of conversational prompts, including those requiring specific instructions.",
